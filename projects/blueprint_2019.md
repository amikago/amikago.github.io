When the team is not busy organizing [__HackMIT__](https://hackmit.org) (MIT’s annual collegiate hackathon), we have our hands full with [__Blueprint__](https://blueprint.hackmit.org), a weekend-long learnathon and hackathon for local high schoolers. Hackathons are celebrations of computer science, where like-minded and enthusiastic individuals gather to just _make_. It’s high-energy, exhilarating, breathtaking even, but admittedly. . . intimidating.

After being on both the marketing and logistics committees for HackMIT for the past 2 years, I’ve picked up on some of the nuances involved in event planning, especially for an occasion that lends itself well to the experienced and less so for the newcomers. No event can do everything, and that’s absolutely okay. From the very beginning, Blueprint's mission has been to provide an encouraging environment for learning. We can condense our main goals into the following:

1. __outreach__ towards historically under-represented groups in the technology industry
1. __support__ newcomers and beginners – for the majority of these students, this is their first time interacting with programming (if at all) outside of the classroom!
1. __inspire__ continued involvement in computer science

How can we maximize something as simple yet holistic as event branding to convey our values? Tech culture itself has its own set of heavy issues that can’t just be solved with _goOD dESigN_, but I like to think we offered a sense of approachability to everyone who interacted with our work, whether they physically joined us over the weekend, or even just glanced at a Facebook ad in passing.

Nevertheless, I am incredibly humbled to have led and learned from such a talented group of designers; some bits of our endeavors can be found below.


### the building blocks

We began with our style guide: color, typography, design elements, and logo. The marketing team quickly decided that we wanted something __clean__ yet __playful__.

Blueprint’s color palette, without a doubt, includes multiple shades of blue. Past Blueprints have primarily made the blue the center of attention, but this year, it became a dutiful member of the primary color trio. Yellow was featured for the learnathon (the color coordinates with [__StartHacking__](https://starthacking.org), our intro to “hacking” course) and red was featured for the hackathon.

Since its conception in 2014, Blueprint’s logo has been the letter _b_ in the chosen typeface. It’s straightforward, but the variations I drafted were lackluster or had no substance. And so I tried something different: a stack of three squares, resembling a portion of a keyboard or even- _building blocks_. Each block embodies an action highlighted in our motto, "learn, imagine, create". The blocks, individually, aren't very interesting, but put together, form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.

The other fundamentals - singular sans serif font, spacious dot grid, geometric shapes, bars of colors (mimicking dna barcodes and the endless opportunities they represent), etc. - contribute to the modular design vocabulary. The objective was to provide a basic set of rules which would craft a variety of compositions; this parallels the belief that our participants don’t necessarily need years of knowledge to build something cool! A good portion of our marketing team was also new to graphic design, and so I consciously selected components that were cohesive but still allowed plenty of room for experimentation.

With the minimalistic guidelines, it was essential to not get carried away with just generating _#aesthetic_ designs. We focused our subsequent efforts on arranging these building blocks to construct our intended vision.


### on the web

Our [__homepage__](https://blueprint.hackmit.org) was likely to be the participant's first encounter with our brand. We played with an array of motion graphics alongside the scrolling action to support a responsive and dynamic experience.

Meanwhile, our registration page remained static. The homepage is rebuilt from scratch each time, while we typically reuse our designated registration portal, [__Quill__](https://github.com/techx/quill). Thus, Marketing's job was fairly limited; we simply redressed the fonts and colors, but it didn't mean that the result had to be any less fun. We worked within our confines, putting together a background that was personable, highlighting photos from past Blueprints.

The greatest thanks to our amazing!!! development team for making our dreams come true: Lillian Bu, Kye Buchard, Kevin Fang, Rinik Kumar, Jason Kung, & Lauren Oh!

### digital and physical materials

I was always thrilled (and proud!) to see how each of my teammates interpreted the style guide and translated it into something extraordinary.

For myself, my favorite creation was piece the above. Each square was released in succession before registration closed, building hype for Blueprint and hopefully being that push for an unsure soul! As someone who enjoys illustrating, I'm indeed always looking for excuses to insert something hand-drawn, contrasting with the sleek typography and vector geometries. The cutesy art style and mostly feminine/androgynous features were all intentional (if not a bit ulterior on my end, haha).

I also devised a cipher that rendered the letters of the alphabet into varying sized and colored blocks. Text was converted into these blocks and placed on the banners and badges. Although I've lost the code (scribbled haphazardly on scrap paper) and I highly doubt anyone would be able to crack ~~or even notice~~ it, it's amusing to look back at the patterns and know that there is more than meets the eye.

Were we able to step closer to our lofty goals?

This year, we had the most applicant than ever before. Statstically, 44% of our attendees identified as non-male and 10% identified as a racial minority in tech (the national numbers are 21% and 10%, respectively). However, it is unfair to both us and them to reduce them into figures - we left the weekend with innovative projects, renewed inspiration, and best of all, students wanting more. Branding is only a small (albeit important!) part of the success of the event, and there are many external factors that contribute to the data - we can only improve from now.

I am incredibly admiring of the outreach committee (personally visited local high schools!), the logistics committee (coordinated engaging events on top of the learnathon and hackathon), and the development committee (patiently listened to my picky requests!). And, I want to give a special thank you to my marketing team, who were all wonderful to work with and absolutely dedicated to capturing Blueprint's mission.

The following are just some late-night retrospective thoughts for future exploration:

1. __motion__: our homepage was the only asset that had any moving parts (the magic of javascript - thank you devs!), but the simplicity of our designated motifs contains plenty of potential for animation. Moving graphics represent adaptability and could offer a fresh form of play for us as designers.
1. in a similar vein, __play as a theme__: I initially pushed for our motto to include play, however our team worried over the childish connotations, especially interpreted by high schoolers. It became secondary, but probably for the better - as I am still trying to understand what constitutes as "playful design" without being gimmicky.
1. __user experience__: designing for an event shouldn't stop at the visuals. Beautiful graphics and quality swag are definitely perks and assist in generating immersion in the brand, however, people ultimately remember their experiences, whether they were face-to-face or through a screen. As the marketing director, I spent more time fine-tuning how something _looked_ over how it _felt_. How the HackMIT team and our Blueprint event interact with our participants is actually the most crucial aspect to design.

All of my appreciation goes towards the opportunity to orchestrate the visual identity for my very last event with the HackMIT team - I dearly cherish all of my memories from the past two years and am nothing but excited to see where HackMIT and Blueprint will go!

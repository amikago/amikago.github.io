The final assignment for 4.022 Design Techniques & Technologies tasked us with conceptualizing and building a 10-foot inflatable structure that exhibited at least two active states.

Inflatables are eccentric forms of architecture - compact, transient, and kinetic, contrasting with traditional buildings. When going about brainstorming, I asked myself the following questions:

1. __How do we take advantage of the organic, non-linear nature of inflatables?__ I wanted to preserve the subversive behavior of kinetic architecture and create a habitat that could only exist because it was inherently flexible.
1. __How can we preserve a sense of beauty?__ My initial perception of an inflatable was that of bounce houses and pool floats, both graceless and cumbersome objects.
1. __What are our active states?__ The distinction of _active states_ in the brief was crucial; this ruled out any "off" configurations such as deflation.

Our solution was a single structure that could take on several states as part of a sequence. Each state is associated with a unique space with a unique purpose, some examples depicted above: a shelter, wall, tower, seating area, back to a shelter. The passage through the active states is nearly effortless, connoting the name of our project, _flow_, inspired by both the __airflow which supports it__ and the __choreographic flow which defines it__.


### prototyping

Our early concepts involved connected chambers that would unfurl and expand. The journey of air would dictate two different active states. In reality, the division between the states was weak and the larger versions performed poorly. The new ratio of air pressure to mass struggled to defy gravity, which left our prototype sadly lying on the ground like dirty laundry.

Still using the chambers, we pivoted to a series of pre-inflated components that, when manipulated, would generate individual active states. And thus we began iterating on our transformable space.

Every few days, we produced 1 - 2 modestly sized prototypes. We learned early on that rigor was required to amass a thorough catalogue of behaviors. Each prototype began as a template designed in Rhino and laser cut onto mdf before being transferred to the plastic sheets and heat-sealed by hand.

Features we explored were:
1. __shape__: the chambers evolved from a circle to a semicircle to a crescent to an arc until we reached the final swoosh contour.
1. __silhouette__: once we finalized the swoosh shape, we played with the relative length and width of the legs, tapering, the size of the diaphragm (center of the swoosh), etc.
1. __connection points__: the shape, size, and position of the openings between the chambers affected how air moved through the structure (which was less important now) but also the fluidity of the entire aggregation.
1. __framework__: our inflatable appeared as a pile of plastic when deflated, therefore we discussed something similar to boning in corsets to provide some support - the endeavor proved to be too time and material-consuming (around 15 feet of wire in one prototype chamber) and obstructed our final choreography.
1. __symmetry__: our discovery of using an asymmetrical form was exciting - it expanded the amount of configurations and was visually 'unexpected'.

### construction

Fabrication was an arduous task with our prototypes and even more so with the scale of our final version. The full-sized structure proved much too large to laser cut (we were already assembling multiple pieces of mdf) and so it was put together with two sheets of plotter paper. We took over a hefty portion of the studio floor and often just found ourselves surrounded by mounds of plastic.

We used a soldering iron to heat-seal the chambers. It was slow but crucial to be careful; we already experienced plenty of mistakes during the prototyping period (burning accidental holes through the sheets, missing spots and leaving gaps that were uglily patched with tape, etc.) that would ruin the quality of our craft.

My left palm was also involved in a minor accident (watch where you put your hands down and always turn off heating devices when you leave the room!) but it’s healed nicely by now. What’s an architecture studio without a bit of pain, haha!

The final step was to invent a mechanism that could encode the active states into the inflatable. After considering the additions of velcro and snap fasteners, we decided on a drawstring system using grommets located at the center of the swoosh. How tightly we cinched and arranged the chambers would lead to varying compositions.

(You can see that one of the grommets fell off! We did some last-minute surgery before our critique.)

An air mattress pump inflated our prototypes, but it proved to be ineffective for the final creation. The other pump available (the bounce house fan) was much too powerful, so we established intentional holes in the inflatable to balance the pressure and airflow from using it. The only hose available was also too narrow, so we fashioned our own with the plastic material and devised a simple attachment and detachment system from our structure.

We presented a choreography of three states at our critique, starting at the teepee, moving through the tunnel, and ending at the nook.

The __teepee__ is created by tight cinching and a raising procedure and is only possible due to the asymmetrical form of the chambers. The resulting arrangement is dramatic and acts as a pavilion, allowing free flowing interaction through its open structure.

The __tunnel__ is created by loose cinching and a toppling procedure. The resulting arrangement is a pathway between two areas - it is inhabitable, a shield from the outside environment, and encourages movement.

</figure>

The __nook__ is created by tight cinching on one end and a buckling procedure. The resulting arrangement is a hideaway that recedes into an enclosed space. It is much less inviting than the previous two forms and encourages individual occupancy.

_Flow_ was well-received at the critique - the most rewarding part was watching our classmates, the professors, and even the critics experience and play with our inflatable structure.

A few considerations from critique:

1. Having an infinite number of states opens up “endless possibilities” but ends up muddling the already defined states.
1. Architecture is brought to life through human interaction, but where is the line for when this interaction becomes contrived?
1. The original scenario was to place the inflatables in the library. For future considerations, what changes can we make so that our inflatable can exist in the real world?

The entire process from designing to revising to the actual making was exhausting, especially when we would spend our entire day in studio, soldering. Yet, I am infinitely proud of what we accomplished and how much I learned from working at such an extensive scope.
